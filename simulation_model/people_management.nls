  ;"needs" are a central driver in decision-making (e.g. eating, belonging to groups, physical security).
  ;"needs" are a relevant concept for accounting for the reasons that can push an agent for violating guidelines, in spite of generally complying to them
  ;"needs" can be seen as criteria that agents tend to satisfy.
  ;As a criteria, each need can be related to a level of satisfaction
  ;Each need is related to a prevalence, i.e. how much this need is "active" or is "bothering agent decision".
  ;The less a need is currently satisfied, the more prevalent it becomes (comparatively to other times when the same need has been satisfied); i.e. prevalence is monotonous wrt need satisfaction
  ;Each need is related to a specific prevalence measure: certain needs can become suddently very critical while the criticality of others is more smooth
  ;Likewise, a relative ordering exists within needs/prevalence (e.g. a person both hungry and lonely is likely to eat alone whereas a mildly-fed lonely person is more likely to share).

  ;Agents tend to act towards satisfying the most pressing needs first;
  ;satisfying needs tends to require active engagement and satisfied needs tend to be less cognitively important for the agent

  ;Various needs have a relative *prevalence* for the agent (e.g. eating is less relatively important than breathing), which then affect how much the agent will aim to satisfy this need when acting
  ;Agents assign different priorities for their needs, this priority order is culturally-sensitive and can thus shape collective responses

  ;For follow-up coders:
  ;More needs can and should be added as one sees fit
  ;Here, I rely on very simplified [0,1] variables for memorizing when was the need satisfied for the last time and making the maths easy.
  ;Though, in principle, needs are shaped by the history of the agent rather than "regularly growing" and thus more advanced representations are advised --if needed.
  ;For instance, a "food-security" need should be much more prevalent if the agent experienced forced hunger due to a shortage

  ;Currently, the need level and the prevalence are weighted and scaled within [0,1], where 1 means "the most prevalent ever" and "the least satisfied ever".
  ;Keeping the scale is very important for conceptual coherence.

  ;Regarding assumptions/scale, my gut feeling (to be checked against theory) is that available plans and need prevalence should evolve over time when the agent faces new situations
  ;Notably, new plans for satisfying should be learnable by agents (e.g. satisfying physical-activity needs might need some adaptation when locked in)
  ;and traumatic events or long-term deprivation should affect the need structure (e.g. food deprivation should dramatically bump up the prevalence of food safety, thus causing rush to supermarkets for instance)

  ;;need-related aspects
  ;note that these terminal variables could/should eventually end-up as functions based on more specific needs
  ;here are two needs for the sake of illustration
